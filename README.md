# SweAIT
**Software Engineering AI Thinking** (pronounced “sweet” 😅) is an LLM-based learning framework designed for working professionals. I’ve been developing this framework since the release of ChatGPT-3.5, but the early models—and my initial approaches—weren’t effective enough for teaching the concepts clearly, at least for me. Later, I switched to Claude, especially the Sonnet models, which significantly improved how I learned and practiced effective coding techniques.

## Oth version of SweAIT 
When ChatGPT-4o was released, I built long, verbose prompts to generate structured notes on classical machine learning algorithms, complete with coding examples. This approach worked well for a while, but it gradually became unnecessary as LLMs began abstracting away much of the underlying complexity. Interest shifted away from core algorithms and mathematical foundations, so I pivoted toward learning prompt engineering, generative AI application development, automation, RAG systems, and vector databases. Phase was rapid and I needed more robust system which leverages LLMs power.

## 1st version of SweAIT a.k.a CORTEX
I called this framework CORTEX. It was well structured in terms of workflow, and LLMs were generally able to follow it. However, something was missing: the learning was entirely passive. It produced outputs that created a false sense of progress. The generated code and explanations were often too verbose, with no guardrails around how to teach or when to stop generating material.

Around the same time, I was exploring the Zettelkasten (Slip-Box) method of writing and wanted to adapt this approach to software engineering. There were also gaps in my understanding of LLM capabilities, my own learning style, and the limited time I could devote alongside professional work. As a result, I wasn’t able to use the framework as effectively as I had hoped.

after one year... SweAIT was born with all the previous experience and more evolved.
